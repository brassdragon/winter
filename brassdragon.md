# 3D Animation Machine

## Summary

I am planning to jailbreak a Nintendo 3DS, and use its 3D abilities to try and create 3D animation with 2D drawings. Hopefully, i will be able to make a short animation with 3D characters and objects. I'm very excited to build this, as it seems like something that's very doable, and fun to do.

## Plan

First, i'm going to install a software such as Homebrew onto the device, which will give me the freedom on the device that will make this project possible. Then, i should be able to freely use the 3DS's 3D features. After this, i should be able to make a short 2D film and make it into a 3d one! Ill capture the footage on the device, and then transfer it to my laptop via Micro SD card. I'll be using my laptop, a 3DS, an R4 Card, and a Micro SD card alongside it.

## Budget

I'm going to need a 3DS, a charger, and a Micro SD card. I'm borrowing an R4 card from a friend, and a laptop to use for jailbreaking the device.
